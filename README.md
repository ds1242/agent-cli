# Toy Agent-CLI
This is a very basic attempt at setting up an AI Agent. I have setup files that it can edit in attempt to guardrail it but this should NOT be used in production.
It uses Gemini 2.5 to and checks the functions I have specified and can identify and edit some of those python files in the calculator app attached to this project.
